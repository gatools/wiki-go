2. **Customize Columns**: Adjust column names to match your workflow
3. **Add Details**: Include due dates, assignees, or priority levels in task descriptions
4. **Use Formatting**: Leverage **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and [links](https://example.com) in tasks
5. **Nested Tasks**: Break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks
6. **Multiple Boards**: Use different boards for different projects or teams

## Advanced Features Demonstrated

- **Multiple Boards**: This document shows multiple kanban boards in one document
- **Nested Tasks**: Sub-tasks with proper indentation
- **Rich Formatting**: Tasks with bold text, italics, and other markdown formatting
- **Contextual Information**: Tasks include dates, priorities, and additional context
